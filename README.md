UFO Sightings BIS015L Group Project
Carmen Doria, Dellaraam Pourkeramati, and Jaskaran Halait

## Overview
This repository serves as a centralized location for organizing and managing the data 
of UFO sightings. The data was sourced from the UFO Sightings dataset
available on Kaggle, accessible here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings

Our primary objective was to conduct a comprehensive exploration of UFO Sightings over the years, 
aiming to identify and analyze and discernible trends. While sightings were documented globally, our focus was primarily on reports within the United States. 
Through our analysis, our aim was to determine any patterns or correlations that may offer insights into the phenomenon of these reports.
